# **P4 Migration System Overview**

## **Introduction**

The P4 Migration System is a data modernization initiative designed to transition legacy COBOL-based databases into a scalable, cloud-native architecture on AWS. The goal is to ensure long-term maintainability, high availability, and efficient querying capabilities by leveraging AWS services like DynamoDB, S3, Glue, and Athena.

## **Legacy System Overview**

The original data system consists of three COBOL databases:

1. **Master DB** – Core reference and metadata tables.
2. **Journal/Transaction DB** – High-volume transactional data.
3. **JFE DB** – Specialized processing and auxiliary records.

Each of these databases contains multiple tables with unique structures and interdependencies.

## **Modern AWS Architecture**

The new system is based on a hybrid architecture involving:

* **DynamoDB** – Tables from COBOL systems are being migrated into DynamoDB for operational use.
* **Amazon S3** – Migrated data is exported into S3 in **CSV** format initially, with ongoing conversion to **Parquet** for optimized querying.
* **AWS Glue** – Glue crawlers and ETL jobs are configured to catalog and transform data for analytics purposes.
* **AWS Athena** – Glue-cataloged tables can be queried directly using SQL via Athena, providing quick and cost-effective data access.

## **Environments**

The migration is organized across three distinct environments to support development, testing, and eventual deployment:

* **Dev** – Used for internal testing and proof-of-concept development.
* **Staging** – Actively maintained for integration testing and validating transformations.
* **Production** – Migration has not yet begun; will be initiated post-validation in staging.

## **Current Status**

* COBOL databases have been partially migrated to DynamoDB and S3.
* Some datasets have been converted to Parquet and made queryable via Athena.
* Glue crawlers and jobs are actively developed in **Staging**.
* Environment-specific configuration is in place, but **Production** is yet to be finalized.

## **Next Steps**

This documentation will be expanded to include:

* Detailed list of Glue jobs and workflows
* S3 path mappings per database/table
* DynamoDB table mappings and schemas
* Athena database structures
* Data lineage, job schedules, and migration checkpoints
